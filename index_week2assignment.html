    <h2>|Verse 1|</h2>
    <p>I am not the only traveler</p>
    <p>Who has not repaid his debt</p>
    <p>I've been searching for a trail to follow again</p>
    <p>Take me back to the night we met</p>

</section>
<h2>|Verse 2|</h2>
<p>And then I can tell myself</p>
<p>What the hell I'm supposed to do</p>
<p>And then I can tell myself</p>
<p>Not to ride along with you</p>

    <h2>|Chorus|</h2>
    <p>I had all and then most of you</p>
    <p>Some and now none of you</p>
    <p>Take me back to the night we met</p>
    <p>I don't know what I'm supposed to do</p>
    <p>Haunted by the ghost of you</p>
    <p>Oh, take me back to the night we met</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>|Verse 3|</h2>
    <p>When the night was full of terrors</p>
    <p>And your eyes were filled with tears</p>
    <p>When you had not touched me yet</p>
    <p>Oh, take me back to the night we met</p>
